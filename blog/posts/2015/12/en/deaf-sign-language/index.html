        <div class="entry">
          
            <p><em>This article is based in an essay I wrote for an English class in the second semester of
2015</em></p>
<p>The first time I heard somebody was studying Deaf Sign Language was from my auntie. It
seems that the city is giving free classes to learn the Colombian Deaf Sign Language. But
what is a Deaf Sign Language?.</p>
<p>Before searching a little in Internet, I thought that the Deaf Sign Language was a
language constructed mapping words from a Hearing Language, like Spanish, to hand
gestures. This means, I thought, they only use a different set of skills to carry the
words they are making, just like writing requires a different set of skills to what
speaking requires, thus using the same Spanish grammar as I use. So, basically, if you
want to learn Sign Language, I thought, you only need to learn to write or speak again
using a different set of skills, with your hands mainly.</p>
<p>That sounds right, but it isn’t, I was completely WRONG!.</p>
<p>Actually a Deaf Sign Language (DSL) is a completely, usually, unrelated language to the
language the hearing people speak in the same region. I was really surprised to know that
there isn’t <strong>the</strong> “Spanish” DSL but there is a Colombian DSL, a Mexican DSL, a Spanish
DSL</p>
<p>In my mind I had the idea that every deaf person who lives in a country in which Spanish
is the <em>lingua franca</em> should speak the Spanish deaf version of the language with their
hands, but it is a foolish thought. Yes, ‘we’ were conquered by Spain some hundred years
ago, and yes, ‘we’ (my ancestors) were forced to speak Spanish over whatever language they
spoke, and yes, that is the reason why we speak Spanish, and that why so many people speak
Spanish in a so big and sparse place that is Latin America. But none of that counts for
the DSL, because presumably the conquers didn’t speak any sign language or the language
was never transmitted or forced on the people.</p>
<p>Actually the Spanish (from Spain) DSL has its own roots in the French Sign Language from
the mid-19th century, too late to be carried by the conquers to the “new” world. And also,
there is not as much deaf people as there is hearing people, it is difficult to pass a DSL
from one speaker to another, it is difficult to learn/teach any language if the interested
people are spread all over a region in a low density.</p>
<p>In this sense, spoken/written Spanish and the CSL (Colombian Sign Language), or the
whatever other sign language that is used in a region where is Spanish is spoken, are not
necessarily related. Of course, languages borrow words from each other, and sign languages
are no exception, but Sign Languages are not created by individuals, hearing people for
example, and then learn by deaf, they are just like any other language, they develop from
human interaction.</p>
<p>Languages are developed by the people who use them and in the case of the CSL are the
Colombian deaf community who developed it, or in the case of the Spanish Sign Language
(SSL) are the Spanish deaf community who developed it, etc. This means, SSL and CSL are
probably unintelligible because they were not developed from the same people. This does
not mean that all sign languages totally unrelated between each other either, some of them
make groups of languages and thus belong to the same family, just like Spanish, French,
and Italian belong to the same family.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the deaf sign languages are just like regular hearing languages, they have
their own set of rules for the grammar, spelling (though, many borrow the spelling from a
hearing language to reference places or people, a process called fingerspelling),
vocabulary, and they shape or are shaped by the people who use them. And because the deaf
population from a region tend not to interact with deaf people from other regions, the
languages use to develop independently.</p>
<p>My auntie sing up to learn the CSL because she thought learning a deaf language was an
easy task, something which could distract her from the daily stress of work and family,
and it also could be fun. But as you, dear reader, could guess, what she have though to be
an easy task result in an enormous one. She is learning a new foreign language!, and that
requires her giving a lot of her energy into learn a new grammar, vocabulary, and
hand-body skills. She did not know it at the beginning for sure, but she knows it now, and
now she replies that the administration is losing money with her, because she thinks, she
is a bad languages learner.</p>
