<p>My first ‘real’ step into learning Chinese has been to learn the pronunciation of vowels and consonants in Chinese (or rather, the initials and finals), and later combine them and learn to distinguish between the different tones.</p>
<p>The Chinese syllables are composed of two parts an (optional) initial and a final, so my first step was getting to know the initials and the finals. But first of all, I learnt the basics of IPA:</p>
<h2 id="1-ipa">1. IPA</h2>
<p>I use IPA to know approximately the sound of every consonant and vowel. For an explanation of the IPA system visit <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/chapter3/">IPA explanation | Pronunciation/Ear training</a> from <a href="https://fluent-forever.com">Fluent Forever</a>, it is fundamental!.</p>
<p>Then you can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Mandarin">IPA for Chinese</a>.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Pinyin Article (wikipedia)</a> as we will base our learning in pinyin.</p>
<h2 id="2-initials">2. Initials</h2>
<p>For the initials I first read the Wikipedia’s Pinyin Article (or some of it) and then I create an <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> Deck with “all” the initials using different audio recordings (links to all audio sources at the bottom of this post), you can download the deck from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">Anki Shared Decks</a>: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2069190049">Pinyin - Initials - Multiple recordings per initial</a>, <strong>NOTE:</strong> the deck uses the Anki Addon <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/498789867">Replay Button</a> and relays heavily on it to work, thus this Anki Deck only works in Desktop Anki and its installation is mandatory.</p>
<p>I got the IPA transcriptions from <a href="http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Pinyin_chart">All Set Learning</a> and slightly modified them with the Pinyin/IPA Description from Wikipedia’s Article.</p>
<h2 id="3-finals">3. Finals</h2>
<p>For the finals I did exactly the same as with the initials. You can find the deck from ankiweb: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/509132394">Pinyin - Finals - Multiple recordings per final sound</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-pairs-of-difficult-sounds">4. Pairs of difficult sounds</h2>
<p>Some sounds are incredibly difficult for me to tell them apart, but as I read in <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/gallery/ear-training-flashcards/">Fluent Forever</a>, I could just hear one recording (<a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/here-are-4-key-strategies-for-remembering-everything-you-learn">repeat it</a>) and try to guess to which of two sounds does it correspond. For that, I create (guess what) an Anki Deck. For space reasons, I uploaded the <a href="/blog/data/pinyin/Pinyin__Pairs-v0.1.apkg">deck alone</a> (without the media files (audios)) and the media files separated in a <code>.zip</code> file, which you can find at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>To add new pairs you only need to create (it’s called <code>add</code> in Anki) a new card and fill the fields with the right information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pair Sounds:</strong> Sounds that are difficult for you to differentiate</li>
<li><strong>Written Sound 1:</strong> The first of the two (or three) difficult sounds</li>
<li><strong>IPA 1:</strong> First sound IPA notation</li>
<li><strong>Written Sound 2:</strong> Same as 1</li>
<li><strong>IPA 2:</strong> Same as 1</li>
<li>…</li>
<li><strong>Audio 1:</strong> Audios followed by their IPA notation, don’t forget to separate each audio with an <code>EOF</code></li>
<li><strong>Audio 2:</strong> Same as <code>Audio 1</code></li>
<li>…</li>
<li><strong>Extra Info:</strong> Additional info you want to be displayed in the “back” of the card.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the audio and its IPA notation from the file: <a href="/blog/data/pinyin/all_with_IPA_per_sound-v0.1.csv">all_with_IPA_per_sound.csv</a>. I got all right pinyin sound possibilities from <a href="http://www.archchinese.com/chinese_pinyin.html">ArchChinese</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5-tones">5. Tones</h2>
<p>In <a href="/blog/data/pinyin/Pinyin__Tones-v0.1.apkg">this Anki Deck</a> you will find 30 cards to practice tones. Every time a card is displayed an audio will play with a random tone (from one of the four “possible” tones), and you need to guess which one it is.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this Anki Deck is huge, in fact it contain all the pinyin sounds which are spoken (not all the possible pinyin and tones combinations, that are way more). You can find the audio media on a zip at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>Beware: there are two kinds of 3rd tones in the recordings. The first, the ‘traditional’, the tone that is learn everywhere, and the second, the ‘spoken’ or ‘real’ tone, the tone which you should learn to speak Chinese for a detailed explanation see <a href="http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2008/12/10/toward-better-tones-in-natural-speech">Toward Better Tones in Natural Speech</a>.</p>

I intend to write here my progress while I learn Chinese from zero. That means, I will try to track my progress in this post (or list of posts), the tools I use, the tools I make, my worries and difficulties and what I learn in the process.</p>
<p>I hope I will see in 1 or 2 years to this post and say, well… you did something with your “free” time.</p>
<p>So, after spending 1 week searching for resources to study Chinese, I came up with this study plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2016/01/en/chinese-log-step-1/">Search for information and read the most I can about the basics of the language</a>, which means to read: wikipedia, blogs, books and their commentaries, … (time spent in this step: few days to few weeks)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2016/01/en/chinese-log-step-2/">Study pronunciation of Chinese Mandarin</a>, it’s a tricky language, with many weird sounds (zhi, chi, zi, ci, ji and qi sound incredibly similar to my ears) and tones. Use pinyin for this. (time spent: few weeks to one month or two)</li>
<li>Study spoken Chinese with help of written pinyin. Don’t even bother with the written Chinese, maybe learn some useful characters but not focus on learning them. (time spent: One year to many! Actually, I think I’ll never go out from this level)</li>
<li>Learn written Chinese, or memorize Characters by means of reading, mainly. Don’t focus on learning characters isolated, it’s a dumb idea (Chinese characters represent a sound, a syllable, and many (most?) words in Chinese are compose from 2 or more syllables).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="measuring-my-progress">Measuring my progress</h2>
<p>I will measure my progress on hours using a spread sheet. I don’t wanna use days, because days are no reliable when talking about a portion of a day in a running time of months/years (I could study 3 hours one day an only 20 minutes others).</p>
<p>That’s all!, or at least for now, until I know what more to write, and boy, I think I will write a lot (if not, you know I stopped trying and that I’m really terrible at fulfilling the goals I give myself)</p>

<p>The first time I heard somebody was studying Deaf Sign Language was from my auntie. It seems that the city is giving free clases to learn the Colombian Deaf Sign Language. But what is a Deaf Sign Language?.</p>
<p>Before searching a little in internet, I thought that the Deaf Sign Language was a language constructed mapping words from a Hearing Language, like Spanish, to hand gestures. This means, I thought, they only use a different set of skills to carry the words they are making, just like writing requires a different set of skills to what speaking requires, thus using the same Spanish grammar as I use. So, basically, if you want to learn Sign Language, I thought, you only need to learn to write or speak again using a different set of skills, with your hands mainly.</p>
<p>That sounds right, but it isn’t, I was completely WRONG!.</p>
<p>Actually a Deaf Sign Language (DSL) is a completely, usually, unrelated language to the language the hearing people speak in the same region. I was really surprised to know that there isn’t <strong>the</strong> “Spanish” DSL but there is a Colombian DSL, a Mexican DSL, a Spanish DSL</p>
<p>In my mind I had the idea that every deaf person who lives in a country in which Spanish is the lingua franca should speak the Spanish deaf version of the language with their hands, but it is a foolish thought. Yes, ‘we’ were conquered by Spain some hundred years ago, and yes, ‘we’ (my ancestors) were forced to speak Spanish over whatever language they spoke, and yes, that is the reason why we speak Spanish, and that why so many people speak Spanish in a so big and sparse place that is Latin America. But none of that counts for the DSL, because presumably the conquers didn’t speak any sign language or the language was never transmitted or forced on the people.</p>
<p>Actually the Spanish (from Spain) DSL has its own roots in the French Sign Language from the mid-19th century, too late to be carried by the conquers to the “new” world. And also, there is not as much deaf people as there is hearing people, it is difficult to pass a DSL from one speaker to another, it is difficult to learn/teach any language if the interested people are spread all over a region in a low density.</p>
<p>In this sense, spoken/written Spanish and the CSL (Colombian Sign Language), or the whatever other sign language that is used in a region where is Spanish is spoken, are not necessarily related. Of course, languages borrow words from each other, and sign languages are no exception, but Sign Languages are not created by individuals, hearing people for example, and then learn by deaf, they are just like any other language, they develop from human interaction.</p>
<p>Languages are developed by the people who use them and in the case of the CSL are the Colombian deaf community who developed it, or in the case of the Spanish Sign Language (SSL) are the Spanish deaf community who developed it, etc. This means, SSL and CSL are probably unintelligible because they were not developed from the same people. This does not mean that all sign languages totally unrelated between each other either, some of them make groups of languages and thus belong to the same family, just like Spanish, French, and Italian belong to the same family.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the deaf sign languages are just like regular hearing languages, they have their own set of rules for the grammar, spelling (though, many borrow the spelling from a hearing language to reference places or people, a process called fingerspelling), vocabulary, and they shape or are shaped by the people who use them. And because the deaf population from a region tend not to interact with deaf people from other regions, the languages use to develop independently.</p>
<p>My auntie sing up to learn the CSL because she thought learning a deaf language was an easy task, something which could distract her from the daily stress of work and family, and it also could be fun. But as you, dear reader, could guess, what she have though to be an easy task result in an enormous one. She is learning a new foreign language!, and that requires her giving a lot of her energy into learn a new grammar, vocabulary, and hand-body skills. She did not know it at the beginning for sure, but she knows it now, and now she replies that the administration is loosing money with her, because she thinks, she is a bad languages learner.</p>

<p>With ffmpeg, to copy just a fraction of a sound (<code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wma</code>, <code>.aac</code>, …) or video file (<code>.mp4</code>, <code>.wma</code>, …) use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">ffmpeg -i &quot;$name&quot; -acodec copy -vcodec copy -t $splitLen -ss $start &quot;$new_name&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>$name</code> is the name of the file to split, <code>$splitLen</code> is the length in seconds of the split, <code>$start</code> the second in which the splitting start and the <code>$new_name</code> for the file.</p>
<p>The idea is to copy fractions of the song (or video) in pieces of the same size, so that adding all the pieces we get the original song (video). Here a bash function that does the job:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">splitVideo() {
    # name file to split
    name=&quot;$1&quot;
    # splitting time in seconds
    splitLen=$2

    # total of the song
    totalTime=&quot;$(ffprobe -i &quot;$name&quot; -show_format 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -n &#39;s/duration=//p&#39;)&quot;
    # number of splits required
    numOfSplits=&quot;$(printf &#39;%.0f\n&#39; $[ totalTime / splitLen ])&quot;

    for i in {0..$numOfSplits}; do
        start=$[ splitLen * i ]

        num=$(printf &#39;%02d&#39; $[i+1])
        new_name=&quot;${name%.*}_${num}.${name//*.}&quot;

        ffmpeg -i &quot;$name&quot; -acodec copy -vcodec copy \
               -t $splitLen -ss $start \
               -metadata &quot;track=$[i+1]&quot; \
               &quot;$new_name&quot;
    done
}
</code></pre>
<p>Mode of use: <code>splitVideo &quot;$name_of_the_file&quot; $time_in_seconds</code>, where <code>$time_in_seconds</code> is the size of the split in seconds, for example, if you put 600 it means 10 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/data/splitVideo.sh">Here’s the bash script.</a> It is the same code as in the bash function, just in a bash file ;)</p>
